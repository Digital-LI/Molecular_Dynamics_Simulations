# Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations
a simple toy for Molecular Dynamics Simulations

# set a small goal first
- use computer to simulate the physical and chemical dynamics of molucular interaction
- explore the protein folding **rule** to accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins
- google search: molecular dynamics protein folding
